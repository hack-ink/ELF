# Research Index

Purpose: Provide the entry point for external project research and architecture comparison notes.

## Research documents

- `docs/research/comparison_external_projects.md` - Detailed comparison of ELF and similar projects.
- `docs/research/research_projects_inventory.md` - Inventory of reviewed and pending external projects.

## Notes

- Research documents are decision inputs, not implementation commitments.
- Any adopted direction must be validated against ELF code, tests, and operational constraints.
